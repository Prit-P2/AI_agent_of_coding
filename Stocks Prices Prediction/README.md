# Stocks Prices Prediction

This folder contains code and resources related to predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The project aims to analyze historical stock data and build predictive models to forecast future prices. It leverages Python libraries for data processing, visualization, and modeling.



## Models Used

The following machine learning models are used in this project:
- [Linear Regression, LSTM, Random Forest, ARIMA, etc.]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prit-P2/AI_agent_of_coding.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd AI_agent_of_coding/Stocks\ Prices\ Prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to train and evaluate models:
```bash
python src/train.py
```
Or open the notebooks in `notebooks/` for an interactive workflow.

## Results

Model performance metrics and prediction outputs are stored in the `results/` folder.
